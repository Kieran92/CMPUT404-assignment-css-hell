Gutenberg Changes
=================

I removed everything within the <style></style> tags and sadded in a link to my stylesheets. For my edits to the cssI underlined the photo captions, outlined the photos in blue, changed the background colour to a more pleasing colour, centered the body,changed the color of the author's note section so you can't see it, I changed all the fonts to a cursive format. I tried to make the document look more "old timey" 

Other than these adjustments I did not really touch the HTML for the Guttenburg files in order to preserve the format.
