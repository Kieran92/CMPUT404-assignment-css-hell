			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			
	

				<div id="creepyGif" > </div>
						<p>
				I am a computing science student at the University of Alberta with an interest in software engineering and all things computers. I am passionate about turning the ideas of individuals into tangible reality. I am always excited to learn about and apply new ideas and technology that have been developed. I enjoy working with a team of individuals and alone on side projects. I am a lifelong learner with a diverse background that I wish to continue to add to. </p>
				
				<p>I am an avid sports fan when it comes to American football, soccer, and basketball.  I also enjoy art quite a bit with my favourite style being “Pop Art”. My artistic skill primarily revolve around drawing and design and I frequently employ the use of Photoshop to make my ideas come to life. A lot of my artistic inspiration comes from my interest in comic books. </p>
			<h2>Professional History</h2>
			<p> 
				<div id="workImage"> </div> Currently I am a consulting 	teaching assistant for the course CMPUT 401 at the University of Alberta. I also tutor students in a variety of subjects including math and computer science. I have also worked as a lease return consultant in which I would observe damage on vehicles and report to clients what they should fix before returning their vehicle to the dealership. I have served as a painter and as a shophand at a bodyshop during previous summers while I have been in university. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In my time at The University of Alberta I have worked on numerous projects that have served to prepare me for a career in software engineering. I have worked on websites, android applications, and virtual environments for medical apparatuses. All of these tasks have involved </p>
			<h2>Why Me?</h2>
			<div id="whyImage"> </div>
			<p>I believe that you should choose me for your organization because I am a passionate person who takes pride in my work above anything else. I am enthusiastic and always willing to lend a hand to those who might need it. I enjoy working both independently and within teams of people. While I am a capable leader I am an avid learner above anything else and am always willing to defer to those with a more comprehensive knowledge basis. I look forward to hearing from you and any potential partnership!</p>
