			<h2>Who am I?</h2>

			<p>I am a computing science student at the University of Alberta with an interest in software engineering and all things computers. I am passionate about turning the ideas of individuals into tangible reality. I am always excited to learn about and apply new ideas and technology that have been developed. I enjoy working with a team of individuals and alone on side projects. I am a lifelong learner with a diverse background that I wish to continue to add to.</p>
			<h2>Professional History</h2>

			<p> Currently I am a consulting teaching assistant for the course CMPUT 401 at the University of Alberta. My previous employment......................................In early 1933, while still in high school,[10] Jerry Siegel wrote a short story, illustrated by his friend and classmate Joe Shuster, titled "The Reign of the Superman", which Siegel self-published in his fanzine, Science Fiction #3. The titular character is a vagrant who gains vast psychic powers from an experimental drug and uses them maliciously for profit and amusement, only to lose them and become a vagrant again, ashamed that he will be remembered only as a villain.[11]In June 1933,[12] Siegel developed a new character, also named Superman, but now a heroic character, which Siegel felt would be more marketable.[13] This was a journalist named Clark Kent who pretended to be meek and mild-mannered but was secretly the mighty Superman. He was enamored with Lois Lane, but she scorned Clark Kent and was attracted to Superman, not knowing that Kent and Superman were the same person.[14] This early prototype of Superman was merely a strong human who had no superpowers, nor his familiar costume.[15][16]</p>

			<h2>Important Things About Me: </h2> 
			<p>Superman's first appearance was in Action Comics #1, published by National Allied Publications, a corporate predecessor of DC Comics, on April 18, 1938 (cover-dated June 1938).[34] In 1939, a self-titled series was launched. The first issue mainly reprinted adventures published in Action Comics, but despite this the book achieved greater sales.[35] The year 1939 also saw Superman appear in New York World's Fair Comics. Superman would eventually appear throughout a host of titles, including World's Finest Comics.Initially Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster provided the story and art for all the strips published. However, Shuster's eyesight began to deteriorate, and the increasing appearances of the character meant an increase in the workload. This led Shuster to establish a studio to assist in the production of the art,[35] although he insisted on drawing the face of every Superman the studio produced. Outside the studio, Jack Burnley began supplying covers and stories in 1940,[36] and in 1941 artist Fred Ray began contributing a stream of Superman covers, some of which, such as that of Superman #14 (February 1942), became iconic and much reproduced. Wayne Boring, initially employed in Shuster's studio, began working for DC in his own right in 1942 providing pages for both Superman and Action Comics.[37] Al Plastino was hired initially to mimic Boring but was eventually allowed to create his own style and became one of the most prolific Superman artists during the Gold and Silver Ages of comics.[38]
